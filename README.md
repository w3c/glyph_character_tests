# Tests: Glyphs & characters
Point to interactive tests from here for language enablement, gap analyis, exploration, etc. related to the [Glyph shaping & positioning](https://w3c.github.io/typography/#shaping) and the [Typographic units](typographic_units)sections of the Language Enablement Index.

Another list of interactive tests can be found in the wiki page [List of interactive tests & results}(https://github.com/w3c/i18n-tests/wiki/List-of-interactive-tests-&-results).

This repository is where URLs for interactive tests can be stored and their results described. Create one issue per test and apply the relevant labels to allow for filtering, sorting and export to a test summary page.
